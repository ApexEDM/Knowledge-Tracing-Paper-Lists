# Knowledge-Tracing-Paper-Lists   
Paper Collection for Knowledge Tracing with brief introductions. This collection refers to Awesome-Knowledge-Tracing and also contains self-collected papers.  
To be precise, the "knowledge tracing" is education-based task which estimate students' mastery of knowledge by the probability of they correctly answering questions. Thus, the input of knwoledge tracing is usually defined as the question-asnwering history of a student and an arbitrary question, and the output is the probability of the student correctly answering the question.
